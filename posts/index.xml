      <title>First Rejections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had submitted two short stories to the CBC Short Story Contest.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It was a longshot, given that I have just returned to writing consistently after god knows how many years).  But I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer of reaching high and not rejecting yourself from consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shit thing about these contests is the lack of feedback.  All I know is that my stories weren&amp;rsquo;t the top 1% of what they received.  Beyond that, I&amp;rsquo;m working with nothing.  So I will just keep writing and keep tweaking, keep looking for outlets for these pieces and the next ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Waiting On First Submissions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing forever, but never bothered&#xA;to submit anything anywhere.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what changed, but something snapped&#xA;and now I&amp;rsquo;m all in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently waiting on five submissions. I&amp;rsquo;ll post here after decisions are&#xA;made and I have something to share.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a strange feeling that I don&amp;rsquo;t really care if these pieces are rejected or not,&#xA;the one thing I learned in academia was that it&amp;rsquo;s rarely the case that something shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be published, it&amp;rsquo;s really just a question of fit.  So I am focusing on trying to find the right home for these pieces while at the same time consistently producing more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
